     <h1>About Me</h1>
    <img src="images/me.jpg" alt="Headshot jpg" title="My headshot">
       <p>The merits that one could ever achieve in this short life are destined to be exiguous, as the effort of an individual is so dispensable compare to the operating mechanism behind the haphazard world we struggle within. Being well aware of this paltry self, what I still zealously hope to accomplish in my life is to tell exhilarating and impressive stories.
       </p>
	  <p>
	   I came from a very ordinary coastal city in China, which was certainly far from archaic but still not totally open-minded. I grew up in such an environment where tradition and modernization blended, and it shaped my diverse personality from all aspects. After four years of undergraduate studies in the United States, the comprehensiveness of my cognition of the world has been significantly broaden. I have come into contact with assortment of polymathic ideas, and fundamentally shaped my outlook on life. There are two core spiritual pursuits of mine: striving for the happiness of many others and creating stories. Practicing altruism is my instinct, because I always believe that I was born in pursuit of gladness. Nonetheless, what determines the nature of this world is countless other people besides me. Only by letting the masses gain happiness can make the world in my eyes a more desirable place to live in. At the same time, I am also a person who loves to create stories. My creative inspiration can always be ignited by the various things experienced by all kinds of people in life, and the self-perpetuating desire to frame more stories originated as my nostalgia for beautiful things and sympathy in regard to poor souls. Depicting joy and misery in an artistic way may not directly change the public, but it is likely to allow people to appreciate the necessity of more progressive ideas, and ultimately my story may ameliorate some maladies among our society. 
      </p> 
       <p>
	   Furthermore, I adore cultural diversity. The blending of different cultures is truly fascinating. In the process, we comprehend each other better and establish intimate connection. This is a feasible path towards a brilliant future. On this basis, my short-term career goal is to become a game designer.My long-term career goal is to become an electronic artist who can provide high-quality entertainment for everyone, showing a world worthy of being loved by people in a virtual way, letting the audience or players feel the incredible possibilities of human beings, the beauty of difference, and all kinds of complex emotions.
