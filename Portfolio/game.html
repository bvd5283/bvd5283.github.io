     <h1>Gameplay</h1>
       <p> <b>Fragile</b>  is an action-adventure game played from third-person perspective.Player acts as one of three manipulable characters with completely different positions and identities. They act for their beliefs and pursuits in a dystopian world created by those with supernatural powers among ordinary human, advancing the main story and eventually reaching different endings through desperate struggles with rivals and choices made in special events.
	   </P>
	   <p>
	   At the beginning of a new game, players need to choose one of the three controllable figures to create a new game save, while updating it during the non-combat process of the game at any time. The other two characters that are not selected will become parts of many non-player characters, but they will make different choices in each major incident as important roles that hold the integrated direction of the story, just like what the player does.  This is equivalent to three main characters dominating the evolution of the story. Players only manipulate one of them, but they can also play the other two core roles in the new game. The decisions made by the two uncontrolled characters will be interfered by the player’s actions, but there is also a certain degree of randomness under inevitable circumstances, which leads to different results when two identical decisions are made in an event. This just represents their behavior as controllable characters based entirely on the player's personal will. In addition, other non-player characters will act according to a fixed setting, and make different but established behaviors based on the story direction determined by the three core characters.

	   The game underlines the interaction between people. There is no "pawn" that can respawn indefinitely or "BOSS" guarding a certain region. The enemies the player faces in each battle are those living people in the story. Their survival, death, injury or retreat after fighting with the player will lead to distinct outcomes. The same goes for the interplay between players and non-hostile NPCs. Time within the game will flow at the speed of the real world, and a predetermined event will be forced to occur at a specific point. Simultaneously, players have a given amount of free time for exploring various collection elements or unlocking hidden plots, and they can even start off a new story line due to the key choices made during unrestrained exploration. The various areas in the game world are directly connected, but in most cases where the player has been located is determined by the progress of the story itself. In a nutshell, all the elements of the game are completely dominated by the plot and follow the logic of the normal development of time and space. There is no going back, nothing to do or the progress of the story is completely stalled.

	   <p>
	   The death mechanic will be applied to maintain the rationality of the game plot. Except for dying in battle, any situation that violates the basic rules will be prevented by the game’s own death punishment, such as requiring the player to sneak through a certain area within a predetermined time and the player failing to complete the task, which directly leads to a game over after a battle that has no chance of winning; or a failing rescue for a figure who died due to the player’s slack on the task. The player will be bound to death in the next battle due to the lack of important information offered by this character. Players can try to resist in battles that are bound to be defeated, however, they will eventually die due to the mechanics of the game itself. Different types of death results will be notified to players in different forms on the death settlement page. If the player is defeated in a battle that can be won, the settlement page will show what kind of error has been made during the battle that led to death; conversely, if the player has fallen into a doomed situation owing to improper handling of a previous event, player will be informed of the external reasons why this battle is destined to fail. On the other hand, the player’s negative behavior in normal combat will also be punished by death that cannot be escaped, such as deliberately delaying the battle time, trying to escape when the enemy must be faced, or destroying the scene as the main purpose. In such situations the player's character will soon be killed. Regardless of the death ending, the player can choose to restart the game at a certain time before death in the settlement interface, or justload the archive.

	   <h1>Combat</h1>
	   <p>
	   "Fragile" will present players a tight-paced combat experience with many uncertain factors. The characters that can be manipulated by the player are all humans with mysterious power called <b>"Messengers"</b>.According to the story setting, messengers can consume a kind of mental energy called <b>"Dreamland Capacity"</b>., so as to achieve some miracles that exceed the limit of human physical ability or even contrary to humans' normal cognition of the world. Just as humans use tools of different shapes to complete diverse tasks, messengers will visualize their dreamland capacity in the real world and sculpt them into shapes that are amiable to achieve a certain purpose. The dreamland capacity that has been given a shape is called the <b>"Plastid"</b>, It is a translucent substance with properties between entity and spirit. It will wrap or surround the messenger as its owner along with being manipulated by messenger's limbs and thoughts. There are various types of plastids, such as the limbs of various ferocious monsters, sharp cold weapons, formidable hot weapons, the catalyst of a certain disaster, a collection of notions in fairy tales or heroic deeds, or even some abnormal beings formed by chaotic concepts. The battle in this game takes place when messengers use their plastids to directly or indirectly attack each other. The three controllable characters have their own three different types of plastid options, a total of 9 types of plastids for players to utilize during the game. Players need to choose plastid for the figure they play when creating a new game, and it cannot be replaced in the subsequent game flow. The abilities of each plastids are diverse and unique. They are not limited to conventional attacks such as swinging weapons and claws or shooting ammunition. In some cases, they can distort space and time, create matters, enforce things that do not originally possess that nature, even directly rewrite the causal relationship, etc.
       </p>
       <p>
       The combat of this game focuses on the collision among attack vectors and the significance of strategy in the fierce battle. Dreamland capacity is applied as the power origin for player and the enemy in the game to antagonize each other. It will be expended in the process of employing the plastid to perform various charged attacks or parry the enemy's attacks, and it cannot be fully restored to the maximum during the battle. When the character's body is directly injured, his/her dreamland capacity will be greatly depleted, directly causing an obvious disadvantage in the battle. Once the vital part of the body is fatally attacked, the dream volume will be cleared straightway, leading to the death of the character (player cannot continue to consume dreamland capacity when its value drops to a nonzero limit, but will soon be slaughtered by the opponent). On the other hand, once the amount of the remaining dreamland capacity is few, the plastids will gradually fail to maintain its original performance, and eventually disappear before the dream volume is exhausted. This refers that in majority bouts of a battle, player's and enemy’s assault will not directly hit each other’s torso, but will numerously collide with the opponent’s attack, until one side loses its posture and been stabbed right into the heart.
       </P>
	   During the battle, the character in the third-person perspective will always face the enemy. Any kind of attack will be classified base on eight directions of the screen and "straight/curve". This classification is also applicable to enemy attacks. And the player will be notified the enemy's attack direction through the phantom that briefly appears on the screen before the enemy's attack hits. Players can switch to passive defense mode when responding to the enemy's attack. Just input the correct direction at right moment (push the right joystick or move the mouse), and the character will block the enemy's attack in the best way. However, frequent use of passive defense will lead to sudden decrease in the value of the dreamland capacity, inevitably putting the player at disadvantage. It is only suitable for player to stabilize the situation during the fierce battle. The game mechanism encourages players to take the initiative to attack, by constantly switching the attack mode to complete gorgeous combos, suppressing the enemies' movements until crushing them; or grasping the enemy's weakness in the process of defense to complete a deadly counterattack. The attack mode menu will be displayed semi-transparently around the edge of the screen. Players use a common second set of movement control schemes (push right joystick or shift the mouse) to select the direction of the current attack action, and use other keys to switch between "straight/curve" or "melee/ranged/concept" categories of attack mode menu. The attack mode that the player is being able choose will change due to the current character's state. For example, when the player is under attack, he cannot perform many moves, and when jumping or rushing forward, he will have additional attack actions that are only available under such situations. At the same time, in a battle, players can enter the "tactical mode" to a limited extent. In the "tactical mode", the time in the game is paused, and the player consumes "tactical time", being able to clearly observe the current state of the enemy, having moment to plan the next action of the character. When the tactical mode is terminated, the character will automatically execute the actions set by the player when the game is paused, until all actions are completed or interrupted by the player's input of other instructions in midway.
