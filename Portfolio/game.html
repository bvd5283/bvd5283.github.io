     <h1>Game Design</h1>
    
       <p> Individually planned action role-playing game development project. The story takes place in a fictitious world that is transitioning to a modern industrial civilization and has fantasy elements. A few groups with numinous powers became dominators, known as " Messenger", establishing a stable but hyperbaric rule. Every aspect of ordinary people's life is controlled by the government established by superpowers, but they lack the most basic understanding of the nature of the ruling class or historical events. The overall production efficiency of the society is low, and the basic survival problems of a considerable number of people have not been resolved. The messengers at the top of the pyramidal society have the right to allocate resources and formulate laws, and at the same time continue to utilize ordinary people's cognitive biases towards them, so that the entire society can serve their own interests. However, all this stems from a war of messengers with different positions in the past. The messengers who won in the war became the rulers, while the messengers who failed and survived can only hide at the bottom of the society, becoming targets of persecution and being named "traitors". The social antagonism is serious, civilians try to prove their loyalty by exposing traitors, various factions within the ruler are also fighting secretly for different political demands, and the so-called traitors have been waiting for opportunities for revenge.

	   There are three characters that players can choose to play at the beginning of the game. They have different fighting styles, distinct background stories and motives. Players will experience the complete tale as one of the selected characters, while the other two playable characters along with many other figures will also emerge in the game flow. The player's choice and the outcome of each battle will directly affect the final result of the story. At the same time, players can save the current game progress and start a new game to go through the game process of different characters or another development of the plot caused by the dissimilar choices.
