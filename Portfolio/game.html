     <h1>Gameplay</h1>
       <p> <b>Fragile</b> is an action-adventure game played from third-person perspective.Player acts as one of three manipulable characters with completely different positions and identities. They act for their beliefs and pursuits in a dystopian world created by those with supernatural powers among ordinary human, advancing the main story and eventually reaching different endings through desperate struggles with rivals and choices made in special events.
	   </p>
	   <p>
	   At the beginning of a new game, players need to choose one of the three controllable figures to create a new game save, and update it during the non-combat process of the game at any time. The other two characters that are not selected will become parts of many non-player characters, but they will make different choices in each major incident as important roles that hold the integrated direction of the story, just like what the player does.  This is equivalent to three main characters dominating the evolution of the story. Players only manipulate one of them, but they can also play the other two core roles in the new game. The decisions made by the two uncontrolled characters will be interfered by the player’s actions, but there is also a certain degree of randomness under inevitable circumstances, which leads to different results when two identical decisions are made in an event. This just represents their behavior as controllable characters based entirely on the player's personal will. In addition, other non-player characters will act according to a fixed setting, and make different but established behaviors based on the story direction determined by the three core characters.
       </p>

	   The game underlines the interaction between people. There is no "pawn" that can respawn indefinitely or "BOSS" guarding a certain region. The enemies the player faces in each battle are those living people in the story. Their survival, death, injury or retreat after fighting with the player will lead to distinct outcomes. The same goes for the interplay between players and non-hostile NPCs. Time within the game will flow at the speed of the real world, and a predetermined event will be forced to occur at a specific point. Simultaneously, players have a given amount of free time for exploring various collection elements or unlocking hidden plots, and they can even start off a new story line due to the key choices made during unrestrained exploration. The various areas in the game world are directly connected, but in most cases where the player has been located is determined by the progress of the story itself. In a nutshell, all the elements of the game are completely dominated by the plot and follow the logic of the normal development of time and space. There is no going back, nothing to do or the progress of the story is completely stalled.

	   The death mechanic will be applied to maintain the rationality of the game plot. Except for dying in battle, any situation that violates the basic rules will be prevented by the game’s own death punishment, such as requiring the player to sneak through a certain area within a predetermined time and the player failing to complete the task, which directly leads to a game over after a battle that has no chance of winning; or a failing rescue for a figure who died due to the player’s slack on the task. The player will be bound to death in the next battle due to the lack of important information offered by this character. Players can try to resist in battles that are bound to be defeated, however, they will eventually die due to the mechanics of the game itself. Different types of death results will be notified to players in different forms on the death settlement page. If the player is defeated in a battle that can be won, the settlement page will show what kind of error has been made during the battle that led to death; conversely, if the player has fallen into a doomed situation owing to improper handling of a previous event, player will be informed of the external reasons why this battle is destined to fail. On the other hand, the player’s negative behavior in normal combat will also be punished by death that cannot be escaped, such as deliberately delaying the battle time, trying to escape when the enemy must be faced, or destroying the scene as the main purpose. In such situations the player's character will soon be killed. Regardless of the death ending, the player can choose to restart the game at a certain time before death in the settlement interface, or justload the archive.
